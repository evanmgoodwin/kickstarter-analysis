Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends

### Challenge
From the "Outcomes Based on Goals" chart, we can clearly see that the smaller the goal amount is, the more successful the campaign is likely to be. We can also establish the higher a campaign goal is, the greater the likeihood of it being canceled is. From the "Outcomes Based on Launch Date" chart, it's apparent that campaigns launched in May are the most successful. Keep in mind that these charts represent data from campaigns over the course of several years. Additional charts for each year's monthly numbers is recommended to see if successful campaigns are on the rise or the decline year-after-year.
